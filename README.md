# Gym Tracker
Gym tracker is a simple mobile app made with Xamarin. As the name suggests, the destiny for this app is helping people follow their training on a gym. I made it for myself, to better manage my work at a gym.

## Technology
I have used Xamarin Forms 2.5 with Prism Framework. I decided to use Prism because is very lightwave and it gives very nice navigation tools. I focused only on the Android app.
